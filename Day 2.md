 Which to choose? 
 **In order to choose our desktop environment, We have to see the speed.** 

Windows manager. 

* Only Shell 
* We open Everything in shell.  
* For low processors. 
## Why Linux? 
* It is fast 
* Most used 
* 600 Distros. 
* Most hacking tools. 
* Most secured. 
- And when we say 600 distros, Distro distros means Modified Linux. With different kernal, Packages, Package manager. 

# Distros
 The first is **Debian** 
- In Debian. We have **Kali**, **Ubuntu** And **parrot**.

- In **Arch** We have **black Arch**,**GARUD**
- And we have other distros like 
* Fedoro 
* Red hats 
* Gento 
* Android. 

# Kali Linux 
- It is Debian based For detailed **forensic** and **Penetration testing**. 
* Ui is xfce. 
* Package manager is apt. 
* Shell is ZSH. 

# Parrots OS. 
- Linux distribution based Focus on security, privacy and development Desktop.
